## Dev Notes

### Webpack Notes
These are mainly notes on the fields within `webpack.config.js`. <br/>

* __`entry`__: these are the various entries into the dependency graph that webpack uses to connect to other dependencies. Any new entry point needs to be added here.
This is mostly for adding individual JS scripts since the rest of our code is added by the entry for `index.ts`. If you want to add a new script, you can just add the path
to it inside the array under `app`. **Make sure to not add any scripts under a NEW entry. This will cause webpack to bundle multiple times which will end up running the code multiple times.**

* __`output`__: this describes the path to the bundles generated by each entry point. If you want the bundles to be served from some other file or to rename them, this is the place to do it.

* __`module: rules:`__: this lists how various file types are transpiled to code that can be ran by the browser. That's what the loaders are for. After adding a loader here, you need to 
specify what types of files it processes and then just install it through npm. 

### Notification Documentation
#### Notification.ts and NotificationController.ts
These two are pretty well documented inside the code. Notification.ts provides class definitions for all warnings that we have in the editor. This includes the draft mode. It also contains
the definition for `ConstructHighlight` an object that can be used to highlight a piece of code within the editor. 

#### ErrorMsgGenerator.ts 
This contains the old strings used for warning messages. Most of these are not used anymore, but they were left in the code in case some of the text can be used in the future.


### Suggestion Controller Documentation
#### Menu
This is the main class that provides the functionality for our autocomplete and other menus. It can be used to create both a single-level and a tree menu. This only depends on how the menu
is built and the options are connected. This class also grants access to the DOM object of the menu as well as methods for manipulating it.

##### Attributes
* __`options: MenuOption[]`__: <br/>
array of MenuOption objects that are displayed by the menu.
* __`editCodeActionsOptions: EditCodeAction[]`__: <br/>
array of actions from which this menus options are created. These actions' `performAction` methods are executed when their 
corresponding option is selected in the menu. 
* __`openedLinkOptionIndex: number`__: <br/>
Index into this.options of an option that is currently focused and links to another menu.
* __`children: Menu[]`__: <br/>
Stores all child menus of this menu. This allows the menus to be organized in a tree. This array should only be used to contain the next level of the tree, not all
descendants of this menu.
* __`parentMenu: Menu`__: <br/>
The parent menu of this menu. The tree above it in the tree of menus. `null` if the current menu is a tree root.
* __`htmlElement: HTMLDivElement`__: <br/>
The menu DOM element to which option DOM elements are attached.
* __`static menuCount: number`__: <br/>
* __`static idPrefix: string`__: <br/>
Used for numbering menus with unique IDs in the DOM in case the menus form a tree.


##### Behaviours

#### MenuOption
Provides the definition of our menu options. This are placed within menu objects and are displayed as part of the menu in the editor. These offer functionality for linking options 
to other menus allowing the user code to nest menus. 


#### MenuController
This class provides the main control logic for creating and controlling a menu and its options.
